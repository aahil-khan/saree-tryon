## Key Considerations

### Performance Targets:
- Generation time: < 60 seconds
- Memory usage: < 12GB VRAM
- Output quality: Recognizable garments with clear patterns

### Error Handling:
- Invalid image formats
- Unsupported image sizes
- Model loading failures
- GPU out of memory
- Missing model weights

### Testing Approach:
- Start with small test images
- Gradually test with larger images
- Test with diverse patterns and poses
- Log all results

### Code Quality:
- Clear variable names
- Docstrings for all functions
- Type hints where possible
- Modular design for reusability
- Comprehensive error messages

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Model download failures | Use direct links, have backups |
| CUDA compatibility issues | Test early, have fallback to CPU |
| Low quality outputs | Start with simple images, iterate |
| Pipeline crashes | Comprehensive error handling |
| Memory issues | Optimize batch sizes, model quantization |
| Missing dependencies | Document all requirements clearly |

---

## Next Steps
1. Start Phase 1: Environment Setup
2. Follow the phases sequentially
3. Document progress daily
4. Keep testing frequent throughout
5. Have sample images ready before starting
